Q2A Sort Answers  
=============================

Description
-----------
This is a plugin for **Question2Answer** that has the capability to make answers from the users in the Expert group sticky so they appear on top of the rest of answers, regardless of votes.

Optionally, a CSS to give a diferent look&feel to those answers can be made. 

Limitation 
-----------
Answers cannot be made featured on a per answer basis. Currently only the only criteria is answer-from-an-expert.

Disclaimer
----------
It is probably okay for production environments, but may not work exactly as expected.  Refunds will not be given.  If it breaks, you get to keep both parts.
